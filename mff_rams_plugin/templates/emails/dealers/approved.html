<li>No selling out of a hotel room, away from the dealer area, or away from your table.</li>
<li>A list of confirmed dealers will be posted to the web site and will be included in our ConBook. This listing will include your business name and the description of your merchandise from your application, along with a link to your website if one was listed on your dealer application. Dealers are encouraged to check their listing on the web site and promptly request any changes or corrections.</li>
